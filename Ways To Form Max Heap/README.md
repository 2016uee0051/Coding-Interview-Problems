# Ways To Form Max Heap
[Try the problem](https://www.interviewbit.com/problems/ways-to-form-max-heap/)

Max Heap is a special kind of complete binary tree in which for every node, the value present in that node is greater than the value present in itâ€™s children nodes.

So now the problem statement for this question is:

How many distinct Max Heaps can be made from `N` distinct integers?

In short, you have to ensure the following properties for the max heap :
1. Heap has to be a complete binary tree ( A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. )
2. Every node is greater than all its children.

Let us take an example of 4 distinct integers. Without loss of generality let us take `1 2 3 4` as our 4 distinct integers.

Following are the possible max heaps from these 4 numbers :

```
        4 
       / \ 
      3   2 
     / 
    1
```
```
        4 
       / \ 
      2   3 
     / 
    1
```
```
        4 
       / \ 
      3   1 
     / 
    2
```

As the final answer can be very large output your answer modulo `1000000007`.

Assume that `N <= 100`.
